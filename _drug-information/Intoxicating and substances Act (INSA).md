The Intoxicating Substances Act (INSA) is the main legislation for inhalant offences.

The INSA spells out the offences involving intoxicating substances in relation to inhaling or using, supplying or offering to supply. The INSA also provides for the enforcement powers of the Central Narcotics Bureau, and empowers the Director of CNB to commit an inhalant to an approved centre for treatment and rehabilitation.
