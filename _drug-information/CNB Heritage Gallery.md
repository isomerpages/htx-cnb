The CNB Heritage Gallery tour is a key component in CNB’s Learning Journey programme, and is offered to schools and various public organisations to help members of the public gain a better understanding of Singapore’s history with drug abuse and drug control strategies. It is also offered to schools as part of the [after school engagement](https://www.cnb.gov.sg/educational-resources/core-programmes/after-school-engagement-programme)

Guided by experienced CNB officers, the tour offers visitors a chance to learn about CNB’s history, and a glimpse into Singapore’s history with drugs through a curated display of authentic artefacts, videos and case exhibits. The tour is usually preceded by a talk conducted by a Narcotic Officer on the topic of drugs, Singapore’s current drug trends and the consequences of drug abuse to supplement learning. There will be opportunities to ask questions, and visitors would also have a chance to be engaged in “in-gallery conversations” with the CNB officers.

CNB Heritage Gallery is located at Blk B, Police Cantonment Complex, 393 New Bridge Road, Singapore 088763.
