Notes:
A.  if the website or Isomer is down, the Isomer team will be notified immediately, upon which we'll inform the relevant agency, and in such cases Isomer will assist in resolving the issue.  MOP will not be able to access the site, hence not be able to see anything.
B. For deployment, 
·        Once pages are approved, **and a merge is performed on GitHub,** it will be deployed to Production immediately, with changes being visible to MOP within 5 minutes.
·        Migration failure: During migration, general unavailability is expected considering DNS changes. Checks on potential points of failures - DNS settings, production instances, are done prior to migration to mitigate chances of failure.





**1.  For VICA, we are to provide Isomer team the JS, CSS and website Codes, the team will help us to implement.  Remember the image updates too.**
