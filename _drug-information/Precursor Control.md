**INTRODUCTION**  
  
In Oct 1997, Singapore deposited the instruments of accession to the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 (1988 Convention). We acceded to the 1988 Convention on 1 Jan 1998. The 1988 Convention is an international effort to make it mandatory for signatory countries to criminalise drug trafficking and its related activities. The convention also requires the monitoring and control of precursor chemicals necessary in the manufacture of controlled drugs.  
  
As a result of Singapore's accession to the 1988 Convention, the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185) was amended on 20 Jul 1998 to control the manufacture, supply and possession of precursor chemicals as well as provide regulations on the import, export and transhipment of these chemicals. There are currently 24 controlled substances and they are identified by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) which is in charge of implementing the 1988 Convention.

* Non-CNB controlled HS codes. To indicate “CNB” as the approving authority under the Customs Procedure Code (CPC) field in your permit application submitted in TradeNet.

**IMPORTATION OF FOOD PRODUCTS CONTAINING POPPY SEEDS**  
  
Poppy seeds are classified as prohibited goods by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). Any company or person who wishes to import them or any foodstuff that contain the substance (regardless of the amount or purpose) must submit the Inward Declaration Form which can also be downloaded from [here](https://www.cnb.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/declaration_form22d408f114a46b78a186ff0000079eb0.pdf?sfvrsn=f7706339_0 "Declaration_Form") (PDF, 125KB) together with a certificate from the exporting country or the country of origin of the poppy seeds  
  
The importer must send a sample of the seeds or related product to the Health Sciences Authority located at 11 Outram Road, Singapore 169078 for analysis.  
  
If the sample is in the form of seeds, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Illicit Drugs Division, Applied Sciences Group, Health Sciences Authority (HSA).  
  
If the sample is in the form of food products, it is to be sent to the Division Director, Analytical Toxicology Division (ATL-CFT), Applied Sciences Group, HSA.  
  
The HSA report must be submitted to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). In the event HSA certifies that the poppy seeds are cleared of any controlled substances, ie no traces of morphine detected, CNB will endorse and approve the Inward Declaration Form. With the endorsement by CNB, Singapore Customs will allow the poppy seeds to be imported into Singapore. If the poppy seeds are found to contain traces of controlled substances, the approval for importation will not be given.
