**INTRODUCTION**  
  
In Oct 1997, Singapore deposited the instruments of accession to the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 (1988 Convention). We acceded to the 1988 Convention on 1 Jan 1998. The 1988 Convention is an international effort to make it mandatory for signatory countries to criminalise drug trafficking and its related activities. The convention also requires the monitoring and control of precursor chemicals necessary in the manufacture of controlled drugs.  
  
As a result of Singapore's accession to the 1988 Convention, the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185) was amended on 20 Jul 1998 to control the manufacture, supply and possession of precursor chemicals as well as provide regulations on the import, export and transhipment of these chemicals. There are currently 24 controlled substances and they are identified by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) which is in charge of implementing the 1988 Convention.
