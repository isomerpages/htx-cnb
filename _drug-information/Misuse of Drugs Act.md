Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA)
=========================

  

The Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) is the main legislation for drug offences.

The MDA provides for the enforcement powers of the Central Narcotics Bureau and the penalties for various drug offences, including trafficking, manufacturing, importation or exportation, possession and consumption of controlled drugs. The MDA also empowers the Director of CNB to commit a drug abuser for treatment and rehabilitation in a drug rehabilitation centre.
