# About ADAC 2022

  

The annual Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign (ADAC) is back this June with a variety of in-person events and online activities that you can participate in to show support and rally your family and friends to pledge for a drug-free Singapore! Together, we can build a Singapore without drugs, where everyone can live, work and play safely! Read on to find out how you can support the drug-free cause!

ADAC is a national campaign organised by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) to commemorate the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (also known as ‘World Drug Day’), which falls on 26 June, as designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 1987. The theme for this year’s campaign is _Community Resilience_. We aim to inspire anti-drug advocacy within the communities and raise awareness of the harmful effect of drugs and the anti-drug cause.
