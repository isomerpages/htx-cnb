### 31 May 2022

          The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) held its annual Workplan Seminar on 31 May 2022. Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of National Development, delivered a keynote speech at the event.  
  
2.           In his keynote speech, Assoc Prof Faishal highlighted CNB’s significant progress in using technology to strengthen drug enforcement efforts. CNB is implementing the Mobile Diary, which digitises documentation required to screen persons and vehicles-of-interest during investigations, reducing reliance on manual processes. CNB has also started using portable drug screening test kits to augment drug detection capabilities on the ground, to facilitate more efficient investigations.

3.           Assoc Prof Faishal also emphasised the need for continued engagement in the local and international space. CNB has stepped up its preventive drug education efforts by working with youths, anti-drug advocacy groups and partners under the United Against Drugs Coalition (UADC) to co-create anti-drug resources and promote a drug-free lifestyle. On the international front, CNB will continue to participate in international dialogue and coordinate joint action with international partners to uphold a zero-tolerance stance against drugs. CNB will also support Singapore’s candidature for membership on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) for the term from 2024 to 2027.

4.           At the event, Mr Ng Ser Song, Director CNB, said that supervision provides an opportunity for CNB to support drug supervisees in their recovery and break the cycle of drug addiction. CNB has enhanced its drug rehabilitation and aftercare efforts to support former drug abusers in pursuing drug-free lives. Since 2019, CNB supervision officers have been undergoing training in Community Supervision Skills (CoSS) and piloted the Community Supervision programme. Under the scheme, these officers are able to effectively engage drug supervisees and support their supervisees’ reintegration needs through appropriate referrals to community services. CNB will roll out the Community Supervision programme for supervisees at all its reporting centres by 2023.

5.          2021 remained a challenging year for Singapore due to the COVID-19 pandemic that continued to bring change to CNB’s operations and strategies. Despite the challenges, CNB’s intensive anti-drug operations in 2021 dismantled 25 drug syndicates and made significant drug seizures amounting to an estimated market value of around $18.16 million.

6.           Mr Ng added that CNB will continue to intensify its efforts on all fronts, including enforcement, supervision, community and international engagement and preventive drug education, to tackle the drug problem. Globally, there is an increasing push for more liberal and alternative drug control policies. CNB remains committed to fighting the scourge of drugs, and will continue to transform its operations to realise the vision of a drug-free Singapore.
