# Listing of 13 NPS in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act
**31 May 2022**

With effect from 1 June 2022, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will be listing 3 new psychoactive substances (NPS)1 in the First Schedule, to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) (see Annex A for the list of drugs).

2.           Following the listing of the 13 NPS as Class A controlled drugs, the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of these substances will constitute an offence under the MDA. Persons found guilty of trafficking Class A controlled drugs will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. They will also be liable for enhanced penalties if they re-offend or sell to young or vulnerable persons. CNB will also be empowered to subject abusers of these NPS to supervision, commit them to a drug rehabilitation centre for treatment and rehabilitation, or charge them in court. 

3.           Their listing in the First Schedule will allow CNB to take decisive action against the abuse and trafficking of such substances.

**Global NPS Situation**

4.           There has been a rapid increase in the number, types and availability of NPS across the globe. Based on a report released in January 2022 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, there were at least 1,124 NPS reported from 2009 to December 20212.

5.           Many of these NPS have been reported in overseas journals to have no licit use. Their abuse has been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. CNB regularly reviews its strategies to improve the detection and regulation of NPS, including the regular listing of NPS that have emerged in the market. A significant proportion of the NPS reported overseas are currently controlled under the MDA.
