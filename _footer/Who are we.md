**A Brief History of the**

**Central Narcotics Bureau**
 
The **Central Narcotics Bureau** (CNB) was established in 1971 as the primary drug enforcement agency with a clear and focused mandate – to keep Singapore safe from the harms of drugs and inhalants.

In 1994, the “Committee to Improve the Drug Situation in Singapore” was set up to look into the drug situation and it recommended a total and integrated approach to revitalise Singapore’s strategies against drug abuse at the national level.

The four main strategies are Preventive Drug Education, Rigorous Enforcement, Treatment and Rehabilitation for drug abusers, and finally, Aftercare and Continued Rehabilitation for ex-drug abusers to reintegrate them into society. CNB took on the responsibility of preventive drug education in addition to drug enforcement.
